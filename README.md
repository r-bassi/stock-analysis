# Stock-Analysis

# Introduction

This is a simple application that provides a user with a buy/sell reccomendation for any given ticker symbol (**Not Financial Advice**).

# Algorithm

We're using the Alpha Vantage API to get market data. Using this data, we've identified certain key metrics and generate a score for each ticker symbol. A positive symbol results in a buy rating and vice versa.

# Usage

This assumes that SWI-Prolog is properly installed on your device.

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/r-bassi/stock-analysis.git

Then, build the project:

    $ [gui].
